# SenseHatSamrtClock
Python project to show some information on the Raspberry pi Sense Hat led matrix. NOTE THAT IN ORDER TO RUN THIS PROGRAM YOU WILL NEED A RASPBERRY PI WITH THE SENSE HAT OR CHANGE
THE SENSE HAT MODULE TO SOME EMULATOR.

The led matrix will show the current time all day and you can chooose to see current temperature, preassure or humidity.
ALSO you can integrate it with IFTTT to trigger your own webhooks and has SPOTIFY integration to show you the currently song playing and a nice porgress bar of the song.
SOON will have a google assistant integration.
